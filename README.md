The Annihilation of One’s Life Due to Road Accident(s) Has Been Increasing Due To Human Fallacy. Various Awareness Program(s) Have Been Commemorated to Eradicate Potent Possibilities Over Crust, But The Graph Progess Is Exponential. Here, We’ve Tried to Inculcate a Light-Weight System for Scrutinizing & Conceding Driver’s Drowsiness State Using Eyes as Our Subject, With Transfer Learning Approach. We Have Subsumed the MobileNetV2 Model Over MRL Eye Data, Stratifying It to 02 Classes. In Our Study, We Achieved an Accuracy of More Than 97% & Validated Our Efficacy for Creating a Substantial as Well as an Exemplary Model for Driver Drowsiness Detection.
